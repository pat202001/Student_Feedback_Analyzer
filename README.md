# Student_Feedback_Analyzer
 To analyze feedback from students to their respective faculties using machine learning, you can approach the problem as a text classification task.
 Specifically, you can train a machine learning model to classify the feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
 but in this project it was done in deffrent way  here the feedbac provided by student is processed and after cleaning all the data by  
 removing stopwards and all slangs then compute sentiment polarity to each comment  and also  do  data visualizaion  using different python libraries 
 like wordcloud  and pandas library that will help you  to  extract common  themes and compute correlation between different parameter of the project like teaching practices 
 and improvement  of suject
